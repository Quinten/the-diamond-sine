# The diamond sine

A 1 kilobyte remake of the classic arcade game Boulder Dash.

- Use arrow keys, wasd or zqsd to dig around with the X.
- Circles will crush you.
- Grab all diamonds to clear a level.
- Current level is displayed as a hash in the address bar. Feel free to skip one you don't like, just type a number.

Levels 1 to 10 increase slightly in difficulty. But there are many more level layouts because of the seeded number generator. You can even try decimal or negative numbers, although levels lower than -1 won't have any diamonds in them and they solve themselves.
